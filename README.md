# Tectalic Blog

This is the repository for our blog. We're using jekyll as base with some adjustments to style.
Drafts are in the development branch, drafts can be seen using `jekyll serve --drafts`.

The usual Blog can be started using `jekyll serve`.

Have fun, if you have any questions, open an issue :).

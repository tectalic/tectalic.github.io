This is the tech blog of Michael Johann & Bastian Wegge.

We are two freelancers from germany that work for medium-sized companies in small to large projects. Our primary programming-languages are Ruby and Javascript although we're not limited to those.

### Bastian:

Growing up in a little town with his neighbour being an absolute computer-addict he began to build his own machines from spareparts by the age of ten. Some day his parents decided to buy some new parts which eventually lead to the first windows operating system and the start of his programming career. He started programming from the age of 14. By the age of 20 he focussed completely on advancing his programming skills in different languages, leveraging the power of Javascript and C#. After finishing his apprenticeship with Miele & Cie. he was put into the computer aided design-department, being responsible for developing enhancements for CATIA (Dassault Systèmes) using CAA, a derivate of C++. During this time he was also entrusted with a report project for the executive board members holding all construction projects within Miele. Finishing projects using CAA and the report project using C# / ASP.NET / Reporting-Services the company agreed to put him into the department of web-development. After 2 years of developing J2EE applications and modules in production and supporting the introduction of the Miele Ireland shops he was convinced to become self-employed. Starting with a big global discount supermarket and a big quality-management contract he embedded the methods of test driven development and continuous deployment into his workflow. After the project was finished, he did some small contracts while moving to Münster and also started game-development. He started commuting between Hamburg and Münster for about a year and took part in many interesting projects on both ends. Nowadays he’s mostly doing nodeJS, angularJS, Ruby on Rails for 4 active projects after founding Crossbow GmbH in December 2015. He’s currently learning vim and elixir, teaching Javascript and Ruby and also working as a consultant and ambassador for test driven development.
